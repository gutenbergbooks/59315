<p class="caption1">THE PERIODICAL CICADA</p>


<p>No other insect in North America
excites as much curiosity and wonder
as does the periodical cicada when it
makes its sudden, springtime appearance
at intervals of 17 or 13 years.</p>

<p>After years of living in underground
tunnels, millions of cicadas issue from
the earth as if by a predetermined signal,
undergo startling transformations,
and spread through nearby trees and
bushes. From morning till night they
fill the air with their weird, droning
song. In a few weeks, after mating
and laying eggs, they die.</p>

<p>The periodical cicada, often erroneously
called the 17-year locust, is
widely distributed over the eastern half
of the United States, and occurs nowhere
else in the world. In the North
its life cycle is completed in 17 years;
in the South the cycle is completed in
13 years.</p>

<p>The adult insect is about 1&#8541; inches
long. Most of its body is black. The
legs are reddish, some of the veins in
the nearly transparent wings are orange,
and the eyes are red.</p>

<p>The periodical cicada, known scientifically
as <i>Magicicada septendecim</i>, is
closely related to common cicadas,
which appear every year. The common
cicadas, called harvest flies and
dog-day cicadas, appear later in the
season than the periodical, and the
adults live longer. Their whirring
song, which is slightly similar to that
of the periodical cicadas, but has less
variation in the notes, is a "lazy" sound
that we associate with the languorous
days of late summer.</p>

<p>Cicadas have a beak for piercing
plant tissue and drawing sap into their
bodies. They are large relatives of
leafhoppers, aphids, scales, and other
sucking insects.</p>


<p class="caption2">Some Misconceptions</p>

<p>The dramatic and bizarre elements
in the life cycle of the periodical cicada
have caused the insect to be regarded,
not only with curiosity, but
also with superstition and fear.</p>

<p>Even before the white man came to
North America, the Indians thought its
periodic appearance had an evil significance.</p>

<p>Early American colonists had never
seen the periodical cicada. They were
familiar with the Biblical story of
locust plagues in Egypt, but were not
sure what kind of insect the story referred
to. When the cicadas appeared
suddenly by the millions, some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
colonists thought a "locust plague" had
been visited upon them.</p>

<p>To some extent the confusion between
cicadas and locusts exists today;
cicadas are commonly called locusts.
The term "locust" is correctly applied
only to certain species of grasshoppers.
Migratory locusts, which comprise one
of these species, ruined crops in Egypt
in Biblical times. They still damage
crops in that country and in many other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>Even when the periodical cicada is
not confused with some other insect, its
appearance in overwhelming numbers
arouses fear that crops will be destroyed.
But the cicada does not feed
on foliage of any kind. If the adults
feed at all, they do so by inserting their
beaks in bark and sucking juice. Although
the adults cause no feeding
damage, the adult females make injurious
punctures in twigs and limbs
of trees and bushes with their egg-laying
apparatus.</p>

<p>A false belief that is much less widely
held today than formerly is that the distinct
black <b>W</b> toward the outer end of
the front wings foretells war. The mark
is a characteristic of the species, and is
produced by deeper pigmentation of
the veins.</p>

<p>The cicada cannot sting, and any
story is mythical that tells of cicadas
poisoning fruit by stinging it.</p>


<p class="caption2">How Cicadas Develop</p>

<p>Using the blades of a curved, sawlike
egg-laying apparatus on the end of the
abdomen, the female cicada punctures
the bark of a twig and makes a pocket
in the wood. In the pocket she lays 24
to 28 eggs in 2 rows. She then moves
forward, cuts another pocket, and lays
more eggs. She continues this process
until 5 to 20 pockets have been made
in the twig. The pockets are placed
close together in a straight row. Sometimes
they form a continuous slit 2 or
3 inches long. Moving from one twig
to another, a cicada lays a total of 400
to 600 eggs.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/page3.png" width="357" height="184" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Section through egg punctures showing rows of eggs
About 5 times natural size.</div>
</div>

<p>The eggs are laid in twigs and small
branches of a wide variety of trees and
plants. They hatch in 6 to 7 weeks.
The immature insects are called
nymphs.</p>

<p>The newly hatched nymphs fall to
the ground and burrow until they find
suitable roots, from which they suck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
juice. This is the beginning of a 17-
or 13-year period of underground
existence. Most of the nymphs are 18
to 24 inches beneath the surface.</p>

  <td class="fig_caption">Freshly transformed<br />adult.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>By spring of the 17th or 13th year
the nymphs are fully grown. The
transformation to the adult stage of
the life cycle is soon to occur. Several
weeks before emerging from the
ground, the nymphs start burrowing
upward. When they have burrowed to
about an inch beneath the surface, they
stop and await the proper time to
continue.</p>

<p>When the proper night comes, in
April or May, the nymphs leave the
ground in vast numbers and head for
upright objects. A tree is the ideal
goal if it can be attained. But the
transformation from nymph to adult
cannot be delayed. If a tree is not
within range, a bush or a weed, a blade
of grass, or even a post or a telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
pole, will do. The nymph secures a
good hold on the object, splits its
nymphal skin along the middle of the
back, and laboriously works itself out.
The job of shedding the nymphal
skin is completed in an hour or less.
The cicada is now an adult, but is soft
and white. It hardens and becomes
darker. In a few hours it is fully
mature.</p>

<p>The insects mate within a week after
becoming adults. A few days after
mating, the females lay eggs.</p>

<p>The adults live 5 or 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Not all cicadas pass through all the
stages of development. Many eggs do
not hatch. Some nymphs never get
established on roots, and some die while
trying to shed their nymphal skins.</p>


<p class="caption2">When They Appear</p>

<p>Latitude and elevation produce the
conditions that determine the date on
which cicadas come out of the ground.
In some southern areas the period of
emergence begins in the last week of
April. In some northern areas it begins
in the last week of May. Between
these early and late extremes, periods
of emergence occur elsewhere. The
farther north the cicadas are, the later
they emerge.</p>

<p>The fact that periodical cicadas in
the North have a 17-year life cycle, and
those in the South a 13-year cycle,
should not be interpreted to mean that
the insect is seen only at 17-year intervals
in the North and only at 13-year
intervals in the South. The insects
emerge somewhere almost every year.
The explanation is that there are different
broods, which emerge in different
years.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/page5.png" width="351" height="172" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Adult several hours after transformation.</div>
</div>

<p>Cicadas of the 17-year race that
emerge in any given year comprise a
brood, those that emerge the next year
comprise another brood, and so on.
The same is true of the 13-year race.</p>

<p>While adults of one brood are singing
in the trees, other broods, in different
stages of development, are in the
soil&mdash;perhaps close by, perhaps hundreds
of miles away. They will
emerge when they have passed their
allotted time in the soil.</p>

<p>Most of the broods are separated
geographically, but some overlap.</p>

<p>The number of cicadas emerging in
successive years is not maintained at
anything like an even level. Four of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
the 17 "possible" 17-year broods are
referred to by such terms as "doubtful,"
"unimportant," and "almost extinct."
We have only scattered records
concerning them, and one or more may
be extinct. Only two of the 13-year
broods are large; a few others exist,
but the exact number is not known.</p>

<p>In some years two broods emerge&mdash;one
in the North and one in the South.</p>


<p class="caption2">Where They Appear</p>

<p>The range of the periodical cicada
covers nearly all the United States east
of the Missouri Valley, and includes
Arkansas and Louisiana.</p>

<p>There is considerable overlapping
between the 17- and 13-year races.</p>

<p>Most broods are limited to fairly
definite areas, but some consist of small,
widely scattered colonies. Moreover,
there are scattered colonies that seem
to have little connection with large regional
broods; nevertheless, when
such a colony appears, it is considered
to be a part of whatever brood appears
the same year.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference the
broods have been designated by
Roman numerals. The numerals I
through XVII are assigned to the 17-year
broods, and XVIII through XXX
to the 13-year broods. They are assigned
as though a brood were to
emerge each year, but, as previously
mentioned, there may be gaps, especially
in the 13-year broods.</p>

<p>Numbering of the 17-year broods under
the present system began with the
1893 brood, which was designated
brood I. The 1894 brood was brood
II, the 1895 brood was brood III, and
so on. In 1909 brood XVII appeared,
and in 1910 brood I appeared again.</p>

<p>The following listing shows the more
important broods, the area in which
each occurs, the year of the last emergence
(up to 1953), and the year in
which the next emergence is due.</p>

<p>Brood I&mdash;a small brood that occurs
principally in southeastern Pennsylvania,
Maryland, northeastern West
Virginia, Virginia, and western North
Carolina; 1944, 1961.</p>

<p>Brood II&mdash;occurs along the eastern
seaboard from Connecticut and southeastern
New York to North Carolina;
1945, 1962.</p>

<p>Brood V&mdash;a compact brood that
occurs in the eastern half of Ohio and
throughout West Virginia except in the
extreme southern part; 1948, 1965.</p>

<p>Brood VIII&mdash;occurs in western Pennsylvania,
eastern Ohio, and the northern
Panhandle of West Virginia; 1951,
1968.</p>

<p>Brood IX&mdash;occurs in West Virginia,
western Virginia, and northwestern
North Carolina; 1952, 1969.</p>

<p>Brood X&mdash;the largest brood; occurs
in abundance over much of the northeastern
quarter of the United States;
1936, 1953.</p>

<p>Brood XIX&mdash;occurs over much of the
southern part of the United States; extends
into the southern part of Illinois
and to northern Missouri; 1946, 1959.</p>

<p>Brood XXIII&mdash;occurs in the Mississippi
Valley from southern Indiana,
southern Illinois, and Missouri to the
Gulf; 1950, 1963.</p>


<p class="caption2">The Cicada's Song</p>

<p>A few days after the periodical
cicadas appear, their incessant drumming,
or singing, is heard. Only the
males have sound-producing apparatus,
which consists of two shell-like inflated
drums on the sides of the abdomen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
Two strong muscles set the drums in
motion.</p>

<p>The chorus begins at dawn. As the
temperature rises, the volume swells.
Throughout the day a blanket of sound
rests over the countryside. In the
evening the sound ceases.</p>

<p>When heard from a distance, the
cicada chorus is a whirring, droning
monotone. But if attention is concentrated
on an individual insect, several
notes can be distinguished. The loudest
is represented by the syllables
"tsh-ee-EEEE-e-ou." It is sustained 15
to 20 seconds. The middle portion is
loud and shrill.</p>

<p>Another note is represented by
"AH-O-oo." It has a mournful quality,
and terminates abruptly in a lowered
pitch. It is usually sustained
about 3 seconds, and is repeated at
intervals of 2 to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Other notes consist of prolonged
burring, which is the basic sound of
the cicada, and soft, short purrs.</p>

<p>To begin a note, the cicada lifts its
abdomen (the back part of the body)
to a rigid, horizontal position. When
the sound ends, the abdomen drops back
to the usual, somewhat sagging position.</p>


<p class="caption2">Damage to Trees</p>

<p>The egg-laying habits of the female
cicada, which have been described, can
cause severe damage or even destruction
to young, transplanted trees in
nurseries and orchards, and some damage
to older trees.</p>

<p>Egg punctures can cause the twigs
and branches of small, immature trees
to wilt; and the wounds can give ingress
to disease and serve as shelters and
feeding locations for scale insects,
woolly aphids, and other insects.</p>

<p>Twigs in which many egg pockets
are made are often broken or partly
broken from the tree. Sonic fruit is
lost from bearing trees that have been
severely injured.</p>

<p>Seventy or eighty species of trees,
shrubs, and herbaceous plants harbor
the eggs of the cicada. Those for
which the female seems to have a preference
are oak, hickory, apple, peach,
pear, and grape.</p>

<p>Cicadas cause no visible feeding
damage to plants and trees.</p>


<p class="caption2">Reducing the Damage</p>

<p>The insecticides Sevin and TEPP are
effective against the cicada, Sevin being
preferred when residue restrictions
do not prevent its use because of its
much greater residual effectiveness.
Use Sevin to protect ornamental plants,
shade trees, and some fruit trees
(apples, pears, peaches, plums, prunes,
and cherries), and grapes, for which a
tolerance has been approved. Otherwise,
use TEPP.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION.</b>&mdash;Sevin and TEPP are
poisonous. Read and follow all precautions
on the label. TEPP is extremely
dangerous to handle. Serious
illness, or even death, may result if it is
swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed
through the skin.</p>

<p>Sevin has long residual value against
the cicada. One application applied
when egg-laying begins will afford protection
for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on
the degree of infestation. Repeat applications
only after reinfestation is
evident. To prepare a Sevin spray, mix
2 pounds of a 50-percent wettable powder
with 100 gallons of water.</p>

<p>TEPP acts only on direct contact
with the insect. It does not affect insects
that come to the tree after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
spray has dried, thus orchards close to
woodlands have to be sprayed almost
daily. Orchards further from heavy
infestations can be protected reasonably
well by three or four applications
a week apart. TEPP is most effective
if applied early in the day, before the
cicadas become active. Prepare a
TEPP spray by mixing one-half pint
of a 20-percent concentrate, or one-fourth
pint of a 40-percent concentrate,
with 100 gallons of water.</p>

<p>Orchard trees 1 or 2 years old may
be protected by covering them with
open-weave cloth, such as heavy cheese-cloth,
netting, tobacco shade cloth, or
the cloth used to cover tobacco seed-beds
in the South. The cloth should
be put in place as the cicadas begin to
appear and should remain until, about
5 weeks later, most of them are gone.</p>

<p>Many growers refrain from planting
orchards in a cicada year, or in the
preceding year. Before postponing
the planting of trees, they should consider
cloth protection. The cost may
be less than the loss represented by 1
or 2 years of delay in the development
of a new orchard.</p>

<p>If little or no pruning is done to
large trees the winter preceding an infestation,
much of the injured wood
can be pruned away the following
winter.</p>

<p>In residential areas where the cicadas
have previously been abundant, it
is advisable not to plant young shrubs
or trees around the home the year another
emergence is expected.</p>


<p class="caption2">Natural Enemies</p>

<p>Birds destroy many cicadas. Where
cicadas are numerous and birds rather
few, as in dense woods, cicadas are not
materially reduced. Where the situation
is reversed, as in small, open
groves, or near houses, cicadas may be
greatly reduced by birds.</p>

<p>Insects and mites attack cicada eggs,
and a fungus disease kills some adults.</p>
